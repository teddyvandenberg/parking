# parking
Hello! I am doing a Developer Skills assessment in Perl, the assessment asks to create a program that tracks the status of a parking lot. The parking lot services 3 distinct types of vehicles, Cars, Vans, and Bikes. Users of the program will need to know if they can park there, and the user will need to be updated as the status changes.
